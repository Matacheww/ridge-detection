# Automating Ridge Detection

This project is an extension of my MSci Physics research project - 'Mapping Polygonal Ridges Across the Martian Mid-Latitudes' - in which I analysed user-generated data from Zooniverse.org to determine locations of ridge formations on Mars.  This project will build upon the analysis I conducted to create a machine-learning approach to detecting these ridge formations.
